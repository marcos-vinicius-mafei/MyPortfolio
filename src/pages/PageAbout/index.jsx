                My name is Marcos Vin√≠cius Mafei Machado. I was born in Santa
                Catarina, Brazil in 2003. I'm passionate about animals, that's
                why I have four pets. I like to play some games in my spare time
                and have fun on calls with my friends.
              </p>

                I've always loved technology and I'm becoming more and more
                fascinated and excited about everything the tech world has to
                offer. It's amazing to work with something you truly love.
